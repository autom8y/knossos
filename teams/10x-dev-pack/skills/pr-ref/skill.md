# /pr - Pull Request Workflow

> **Category**: Development Workflows | **Phase**: Shipping | **Complexity**: Low

## Purpose

Create a pull request with comprehensive description, test plan, and checklist. This command analyzes all changes since branch divergence, generates appropriate PR content, and creates the PR via GitHub CLI.

Use this when:
- Feature implementation is complete and tested
- Ready to ship to production
- Need formal code review
- Want documented test plan for reviewers

---

## Usage

```bash
/pr "pr-title" [--base=BRANCH]
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `pr-title` | Yes | - | Pull request title |
| `--base` | No | main | Base branch to merge into |

---

## Behavior

### 1. Validate Git State

Check current git state:

```bash
# Current branch
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD

# Ensure not on main/master
if [[ $current_branch == "main" || $current_branch == "master" ]]; then
  echo "Error: Cannot create PR from main branch"
  exit 1
fi

# Check if branch tracks remote
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref @{upstream}

# Check for uncommitted changes
git status --porcelain
```

**If uncommitted changes**: Prompt to commit first or error.

**If on main/master**: Error - cannot PR from protected branch.

**If not tracking remote**: Will push with `-u` flag.

### 2. Analyze Changes

Gather comprehensive change information:

```bash
# Get base branch (default: main)
BASE_BRANCH=${base:-main}

# All commits in this branch
git log $BASE_BRANCH...HEAD --oneline

# Full diff from branch point
git diff $BASE_BRANCH...HEAD

# Changed files
git diff --name-status $BASE_BRANCH...HEAD

# Check if tests exist
find . -name "*test*" -o -name "*spec*"

# Check if docs updated
git diff $BASE_BRANCH...HEAD --name-only | grep -E '\.(md|rst|txt)$'
```

### 3. Generate PR Description

### Example 4: PR with Uncommitted Changes Error

```bash
/pr "Add caching layer"
```

Output:
```
Error: Uncommitted changes detected

You have uncommitted changes:
  M src/cache/manager.py
  M tests/cache/test_manager.py
  ?? src/cache/config.py

Please commit changes first:
  git add .
  git commit -m "Add caching layer"

Or use Claude Code commit command:
  /commit "Add caching layer"

Then re-run: /pr "Add caching layer"
```

## When to Use vs Alternatives

| Use /pr when... | Use alternative when... |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Ready to ship feature | Still implementing → Use `/build` or `/task` |
| All tests passing | Tests failing → Fix first |
| QA validation complete | Needs testing → Use `/qa` |
| On feature branch | On main → Switch branch first |

### After /task vs After Phased Workflow

Both workflows end with `/pr`:

**After /task**:
```bash
/task "feature"  # PRD → TDD → Code → QA
/pr "feature"    # Ship
```

**After phased**:
```bash
/architect "feature"  # Design
/build "feature"      # Implement
/qa "feature"         # Validate
/pr "feature"         # Ship
```

Both produce same quality PR, different paths.

---

## Complexity Level

**LOW** - This command:
- Analyzes git history
- Generates PR description
- Invokes `gh pr create`
- No agent coordination needed

**Recommended for**:
- Shipping any completed feature
- After QA validation passes
- When ready for code review
- Production deployments

**Not recommended for**:
- Work-in-progress (use draft PRs manually)
- Exploratory branches
- Before implementation complete

---

## Prerequisites

- Git repository initialized
- Not on main/master branch
- All changes committed (no uncommitted work)
- GitHub CLI (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- Remote repository exists
- Tests passing (recommended)

---

## Success Criteria

- PR created on GitHub
- Description includes summary, test plan, links
- PR URL returned
- Branch pushed to remote (if wasn't already)
- Ready for review

---

## State Changes

### Git Changes

| Action | When |
|--------|------|
| Push branch to remote | If not already tracking remote |
| Create PR on GitHub | Always |
| No commits made | Never (must commit first) |

### Files Created

| File Type | Location | Always? |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Pull Request | GitHub | Yes |
| No local files | - | Never |

---

## Related Commands

- `/task` - Build feature before PR (prerequisite)
- `/qa` - Validate before PR (recommended)
- `/commit` - Commit changes before PR (prerequisite)
- `/review` - Review someone else's PR (different use case)

## Notes

### PR Description Quality

Good PR descriptions help reviewers:
1. **Context**: Why this change?
2. **Scope**: What changed?
3. **Testing**: How verified?
4. **Risks**: What could go wrong?
5. **Links**: Where's the design?

Invest in PR description - it's documentation that outlives the code.

### Test Plan as Reviewer Checklist

Test plan serves two purposes:
1. **For PR author**: Checklist before creating PR
2. **For reviewers**: Verification steps during review

Reviewers can check off items as they verify, ensuring nothing missed.

### Analyzing All Commits

`/pr` analyzes **all commits** since branch diverged, not just the latest commit. This ensures:
- Complete feature context
- All changes included in summary
- Nothing overlooked
- Accurate scope representation

### Draft PRs

For work-in-progress, create draft PR manually:
```bash
gh pr create --draft --title "WIP: Feature"
```

Use `/pr` only for ready-to-review work.

### PR Templates

If repository has `.github/pull_request_template.md`, the generated description should align with that template structure.

### CI/CD Integration

After PR creation:
1. CI checks run automatically
2. Monitor: `gh pr checks`
3. View status: `gh pr view`
4. Merge when ready: `gh pr merge` (or via UI)

### Reviewer Assignment

Assign reviewers after PR creation:
```bash
gh pr edit {number} --add-reviewer @user1,@user2
gh pr edit {number} --add-reviewer team/security
```

Or use GitHub's auto-assign rules.

## Error Cases

| Error | Condition | Resolution |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| On main/master | Cannot PR from protected branch | Switch to feature branch |
| Uncommitted changes | Working directory not clean | Commit changes first |
| No remote | Repository not pushed | Add remote: `git remote add origin URL` |
| gh not installed | GitHub CLI missing | Install: `brew install gh` |
| Not authenticated | gh not logged in | Authenticate: `gh auth login` |
| No commits | Branch identical to base | Make some changes first |

---

## Integration with Sessions

Works with or without sessions:

**With session**:
```bash
/start "Feature development"
/task "implement feature"
/pr "Add feature"
/wrap
```

**Without session**:
```bash
# After completing work
/pr "Add feature"
```

---

## Advanced Usage

### Multiple PRs in Sprint

```bash
/sprint "Q4 improvements" --tasks="task1,task2,task3"
# After each task completes:
/pr "Task 1: Description"
/pr "Task 2: Description"
/pr "Task 3: Description"
```

### PR to Non-Default Branch

```bash
/pr "Add feature" --base=develop
# For teams using develop → main workflow
```

### Stacked PRs

For dependent changes:
```bash
# First PR
git checkout -b feature-base
# ... implement ...
/pr "Part 1: Foundation"

# Second PR (depends on first)
git checkout -b feature-extension
# ... implement ...
/pr "Part 2: Extension" --base=feature-base
```

---

## Metrics to Track

- PR creation time (from first commit to PR)
- PR size (lines changed, files modified)
- Time to first review
- Time to merge
- Review cycle count
- Test plan comprehensiveness
