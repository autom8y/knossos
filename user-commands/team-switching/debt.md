2. Display team roster:

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| debt-collector | Catalogs all forms of technical debt |
| risk-assessor | Scores debt by blast radius and likelihood |
| sprint-planner | Packages debt into actionable work units |

3. If SESSION_CONTEXT exists, update `active_team` to `debt-triage-pack`

## When to Use
