## Context

Auto-injected by SessionStart hook (project, team, session, git).

## Your Task

Switch to the Innovation Lab (R&D) pack and display the team roster.

## Behavior

1. Execute: `~/Code/roster/swap-team.sh rnd-pack`

2. Display team roster:

**rnd-pack** (4 agents):

| Agent | Role |
|-------|------|
| technology-scout | Watches the technology horizon |
| integration-researcher | Maps integration paths |
| prototype-engineer | Builds decision-ready demos |
| moonshot-architect | Designs future systems |

3. If an active session exists (hook-injected context shows session info):
   - The active_team is automatically updated via team-validator hook

## When to Use

- Evaluating new technologies
- Building proof-of-concept prototypes
- Long-term architecture planning
- Innovation and R&D exploration

## Workflow

```
scouting → integration-analysis → prototyping → future-architecture
```
