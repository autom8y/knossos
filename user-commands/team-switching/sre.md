| observability-engineer | Metrics, logs, traces, dashboards, alerts |
| incident-commander | War room coordination, postmortems |
| platform-engineer | CI/CD, IaC, deployment automation |
| chaos-engineer | Fault injection, resilience testing |

3. If SESSION_CONTEXT exists, update `active_team` to `sre-pack`
