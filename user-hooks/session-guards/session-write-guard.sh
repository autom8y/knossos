# session-write-guard.sh - PreToolUse hook that blocks direct writes to *_CONTEXT.md files
# Category: DEFENSIVE - must never crash Claude's tool flow
#
# Blocks: Write, Edit operations to *_CONTEXT.md files
# Allows: Read operations, operations to other files
# Response: Workflow-aware error messages
#
# This hook enforces centralized state management through the state-mate agent,
# preventing unguarded writes that could corrupt session/sprint state.
#
# OPTIMIZATION: Lazy init - check tool type BEFORE sourcing hooks-init.sh
# This saves ~35ms on 90%+ of invocations (Read, Bash, Glob, Grep, etc.)

## State Mutation Blocked

State mutations are handled **automatically by hooks** during active workflows.

**Why?** The orchestrator coordinates phase transitions, and hooks invoke state-mate to maintain the audit trail.

**If you need an explicit mutation**, use the appropriate command:
- `/park` - Pause current session
- `/wrap` - Complete and archive session
- `/handoff` - Transfer to another agent

**Do not** call `Task(state-mate, ...)` directly during orchestrated workflows.

    # No workflow or no orchestrator = suggest state-mate
    cat >&2 <<'EOF'

## State Mutation Blocked

Direct writes to `*_CONTEXT.md` files are not allowed.

**Use state-mate for all session/sprint mutations:**

```
Task(state-mate, "<your mutation request>")
```

**Examples:**
- `Task(state-mate, "mark task-001 complete")`
- `Task(state-mate, "transition to design phase")`
- `Task(state-mate, "register artifact docs/PRD-foo.md")`

See `.claude/user-agents/state-mate.md` for full documentation.
