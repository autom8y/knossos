# Worktree Integration

> How worktrees integrate with the broader ecosystem.

## Architecture

### Directory Structure

```
~/Code/project/                     # Main working tree
  .git/                             # Shared git database
  .claude/                          # Main ecosystem
  worktrees/                        # Worktree container
    .gitignore                      # Ignore all worktrees from git
    wt-20251224-143052-abc/         # Per-session worktree
      .claude/                      # Independent ecosystem
        .worktree-meta.json         # Worktree metadata
        agents/                     # Rite agents (isolated)
        sessions/                   # Single session
        ACTIVE_RITE                 # Rite state (isolated)
        SPRINT_CONTEXT              # Sprint state (isolated)
```

### Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Detached HEAD** | No branch pollution, ephemeral by design |
| **Fresh sync init** | Each worktree syncs independently |
| **Auto-session creation** | Worktree comes ready with session |
| **Subdirectory structure** | Clean organization under `worktrees/` |
| **7-day cleanup threshold** | Stale worktrees auto-cleaned |

## Session Lifecycle Integration

### /sos start Interaction

When `/sos start` detects an existing session, it offers these options and references worktree:

```
A session already exists in this terminal.

Options:
1. /sos resume - Resume the parked session
2. /sos park + /sos start - Park current, then start new
3. /sos wrap - Complete current session first

See also: /worktree for parallel work in isolated worktrees
```

### /sos wrap Interaction

When completing a session in a worktree, `/sos wrap` offers cleanup:

```
Session Complete: billing-sprint
...
This session ran in an isolated worktree: wt-20251224-150000-xyz
Remove worktree? (y/n)
```

### /sessions --all

Shows sessions across all worktrees:

```bash
=== Main Project ===
session-20251224-143052-a1b2 | ACTIVE | feature-auth | 2025-12-24T14:30:52Z

=== Worktrees ===
[wt-20251224-150000-xyz] billing-sprint (rite: 10x-dev)
  session-20251224-150000-c3d4 | ACTIVE | billing-sprint
```

## Knossos Integration

Worktree status can be checked via metadata:

```
Worktree Status
------------------------

[WORKTREE]    wt-20251224-150000-xyz
Name:         billing-sprint
Rite:         10x-dev

Knossos:      /Users/user/Code/knossos
...
```

### Worktree Functions

Worktree functions via `ari worktree`:
- `ari worktree status` - Detect worktree context and read metadata
- `ari worktree list` - List all worktrees with metadata

## Rite Integration

### Rite Switching

Works identically in worktrees:
```bash
cd worktrees/wt-{id}
ari sync --rite 10x-dev
```

### ACTIVE_RITE

Each worktree has its own ACTIVE_RITE file, enabling different rites in parallel terminals.

## Git Integration

### Shared Database

All worktrees share the same `.git` database:
- Commits are visible across all worktrees
- Branches are shared
- Refs are shared

### Detached HEAD

Worktrees use detached HEAD to avoid branch pollution:
- No accidental commits to shared branches
- Clean separation of work
- Easy cleanup without branch cleanup
