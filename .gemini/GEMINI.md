## Execution Mode

Use the available agents and slash commands. Delegate complex work to specialists via Task tool.

## Quick Start

5-agent workflow (security):

| Agent | Role |
| ----- | ---- |
| **potnia** | Coordinates security initiative phases |
| **threat-modeler** | Models threats and identifies security risks and attack vectors |
| **compliance-architect** | Maps compliance requirements and designs control frameworks |
| **penetration-tester** | Executes penetration tests and documents vulnerabilities |
| **security-reviewer** | Performs final security review and grants deployment approval |

Delegate to specialists via Task tool.

## Agent Routing

<!-- KNOSSOS:START commands -->
## CC Primitives

| CC Primitive | Invocation | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Slash command | User types `/name` | `.claude/commands/` |
| Skill tool | Model calls `Skill("name")` | `.claude/skills/` |
| Task tool | Model calls `Task(subagent_type)` | `.claude/agents/` |
| Hook | Auto-fires on lifecycle events | `.claude/settings.json` |
Agents cannot spawn other agents — only the main thread has Task tool access.

## Codebase Knowledge

Persistent knowledge in `.know/`. Generate with `/know --all` if not present.

- `Read(".know/architecture.md")` — package structure, layers, data flow (read before code changes)
- `Read(".know/scar-tissue.md")` — past bugs, defensive patterns
- `Read(".know/design-constraints.md")` — frozen areas, structural tensions
- `Read(".know/conventions.md")` — error handling, file organization, domain idioms
- `Read(".know/test-coverage.md")` — test gaps, coverage patterns
- `Read(".know/feat/INDEX.md")` — feature catalog and taxonomy (generate with `/know --scope=feature`)
Work product artifacts in `.ledge/`:

- `.ledge/decisions/` — ADRs and design decisions
- `.ledge/specs/` — PRDs and technical specs
- `.ledge/reviews/` — audit reports and code reviews
- `.ledge/spikes/` — exploration and research artifacts
