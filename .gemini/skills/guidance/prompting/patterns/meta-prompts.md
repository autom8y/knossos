## Check Workflow Compliance

```
Review my recent work for workflow compliance:

- .ledge/specs/PRD-{NNNN}.md
- .ledge/specs/TDD-{NNNN}.md
- .ledge/decisions/ADR-{NNNN}.md
- /src/{path}

Check:
- Does PRD follow template?
- Does TDD trace to PRD?
- Are ADRs complete for significant decisions?
- Does code follow conventions? (see `standards` skill)
- Is .ledge/ updated?
```

## Suggest Next Steps

```
Current state:
- PRD-{NNNN}: {status}
- TDD-{NNNN}: {status}
- Implementation: {status}
- Tests: {status}

What should I work on next? What's blocking progress?
```

## Retrospective

```
We just completed {feature}.

Review the process:
- What documentation is missing or incomplete?
- What decisions weren't captured in ADRs?
- What would make the next feature faster?
- What should we update in our conventions?
```
