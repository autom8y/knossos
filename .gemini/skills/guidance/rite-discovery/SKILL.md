# Rite Discovery

> Provides structured rite metadata by reading from `rites/*/orchestrator.yaml`.

## Purpose

Enables dynamic rite discovery without hardcoding rite counts or capabilities. Other skills (`consult-ref`, `rite-ref`) reference this skill for current rite catalog.

## Usage

This skill provides read-only rite metadata. It does not switch rites.

### List All Rites

Read all orchestrator.yaml files from `$KNOSSOS_HOME/rites/*/orchestrator.yaml` and extract:
- Rite name, domain, description
- Quick-switch command
- Agent catalog (from rites/{name}/agents/*.md)
- Routing conditions (what triggers each specialist)

### Match Intent to Rite

Given a user query, compare against rite routing conditions:
1. Parse query for key verbs (build, fix, deploy, document, etc.)
2. Match against rite domains and routing conditions
3. Return ranked list with confidence scores

## Data Source

**Primary**: `$KNOSSOS_HOME/rites/*/orchestrator.yaml`
**Supplementary**: `$KNOSSOS_HOME/rites/*/README.md` for use cases

**Total**: 15 rites, 65 agents

Note: `shared` is a dependency bundle, not a user-facing rite.
To refresh this table, run `ari sync` which reads from `rites/*/orchestrator.yaml`.

## Schema Reference

See [schemas/rite-profile.yaml](schemas/rite-profile.yaml) for the structured output format.

## Integration Points

- **consult-ref**: Calls rite-discovery for routing recommendations
- **rite-ref**: Calls rite-discovery for --list output
- **SessionStart hook**: May call rite-discovery for context injection
