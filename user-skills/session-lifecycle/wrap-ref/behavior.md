# /wrap Behavior Specification

> Full step-by-step sequence for completing a work session.

## Behavior Sequence

### 1. Pre-flight Validation

Apply [Session Resolution Pattern](../shared-sections/session-resolution.md):
- Requires: Active session (not parked)
- Verb: "wrap"
- Auto-resume offer: Yes (offer to resume if parked)

See [session-validation](../../session-common/session-validation.md) for patterns.

### 2. Run Quality Gates (unless --skip-checks)

Validate artifacts based on session complexity. See [quality-gates.md](quality-gates.md).

Quality gates run in order:
1. PRD Quality Gate (all complexity levels)
2. TDD Quality Gate (MODULE+)
3. Code Quality Gate (if engineer was last_agent)
4. Validation Quality Gate (if qa was last_agent)

If any gate fails: Surface issues, offer resolution options.

### 3. Optional: Invoke QA for Final Review

If `last_agent` is not `qa-adversary`:
- Offer final QA review before wrapping
- If yes: Invoke QA Adversary via Task tool
- Wait for response; abort if issues found

### 4. Invoke state-mate for Wrap Mutation

Apply [state-mate Invocation Pattern](../shared-sections/state-mate-invocation.md):
- Operation: `wrap_session`
- Post-action: Archive session directory, generate summary

**Prerequisites Enforced by state-mate**:
- Session must be ACTIVE (not PARKED)
- If PARKED, state-mate returns LIFECYCLE_VIOLATION with hint to resume first
- `--override=reason` can bypass prerequisites if explicitly requested

**Additional Error Handling**:
- If quality gates fail (checked by skill BEFORE invoking state-mate), offer options
- If PARKED, offer to auto-invoke `/resume` then retry wrap

See pattern documentation for response handling and error types.

### 5. Generate Session Summary

Create comprehensive summary. See [session-summary.md](session-summary.md).

Summary includes:
- Session metadata (ID, duration, complexity)
- Accomplishments and artifacts
- Key decisions and ADRs
- Quality metrics and test results
- Workflow history (handoffs, parks)
- Next session starting point

### 6. Archive Session Directory

After successful state-mate wrap, perform archival:
```bash
mkdir -p ".claude/.archive/sessions"
mv ".claude/sessions/{session_id}" ".claude/.archive/sessions/"
```

Note: Archival is file system operation, not state mutation. Performed by skill after state-mate confirms wrap.

### 7. Save Session Summary

Write to `/docs/sessions/SUMMARY-{session_id}.md`

### 8. Update Session Index

Append entry to `/docs/sessions/INDEX.md`:
```markdown
| Date | Session ID | Initiative | Complexity | Duration | Artifacts |
```

Create index if it doesn't exist.

### 9. Confirmation

Display:
- Session name and duration
- Quality gate status
- Artifacts delivered
- Summary location
- Next session starting point

## State Changes

### Files Created

- `/docs/sessions/SUMMARY-{session_id}.md` - Summary report
- `/docs/sessions/INDEX.md` - Session index (if first wrap)
- `.claude/.archive/sessions/{session_id}/` - Archived directory

### Files Modified

- `/docs/sessions/INDEX.md` - New entry appended

### Files Deleted/Moved

- `.claude/sessions/{session_id}/` - Removed or moved to archive

## Error Cases

| Error | Condition | Resolution |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| No active session | Session missing | Already completed or never started |
| Quality gates failing | Artifacts incomplete | Fix issues or use --skip-checks |
| Session parked | `parked_at` set | Use `/resume` first |
| Git dirty | Uncommitted changes | Commit or use --skip-checks |
| Tests failing | Test suite errors | Fix tests or use --skip-checks |

---

## Design Notes

### Why Archive by Default?

Preserves audit trail, debugging context, and compliance requirements. Deletion available but discouraged.

### Why Session Index?

Provides discoverability, metrics tracking, and project history - "git log for work sessions."
