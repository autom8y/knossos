You have uncommitted changes:
  M src/cache/manager.py
  M tests/cache/test_manager.py
  ?? src/cache/config.py

## Edge Case Examples

### Edge Case: On Main Branch

**Scenario**: User tries to create PR from main branch.

**Command**:
```bash
# Currently on main branch
/pr "Add feature"
```

**Output**:
```
Error: Cannot create PR from main branch

Current branch: main

Switch to a feature branch first:
  git checkout -b feature/my-feature

Or if branch exists:
  git checkout feature/my-feature

Then re-run: /pr "Add feature"
```

**Notes**: PRs from protected branches (main/master) are blocked.

---

### Edge Case: No Remote Configured

**Scenario**: User tries to create PR but no remote repository exists.

**Command**:
```bash
/pr "Add feature"
```

**Output**:
```
Error: No remote repository configured

Add remote repository:
  git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git

Or:
  git remote add origin git@github.com:user/repo.git

Then push branch:
  git push -u origin feature/my-feature

Then re-run: /pr "Add feature"
```

**Notes**: Detects missing remote via `git remote -v`.

---

### Edge Case: GitHub CLI Not Authenticated

**Scenario**: User has `gh` installed but not authenticated.

**Command**:
```bash
/pr "Add feature"
```

**Output**:
```
Error: GitHub CLI not authenticated

Authenticate with GitHub:
  gh auth login

Follow the prompts to authenticate.

Then re-run: /pr "Add feature"
```

**Notes**: Detects via `gh auth status`.

---

### Edge Case: No Commits on Branch

**Scenario**: User creates branch but makes no commits.

**Command**:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/empty
/pr "Add feature"
```

**Output**:
```
Error: No commits on this branch

Current branch: feature/empty
Base branch: main

Commits ahead: 0

Make some changes and commit first:
  # Make changes
  git add .
  git commit -m "Add feature"

Then re-run: /pr "Add feature"
```

**Notes**: Compares branch to base with `git log main...HEAD --oneline`.

---

### Edge Case: Branch Not Pushed to Remote

**Scenario**: User has commits but branch not pushed.

**Command**:
```bash
/pr "Add feature"
```

**Output**:
```
Branch not tracking remote. Pushing to origin...

Pushing feature/my-feature → origin/feature/my-feature

Pull Request Created
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Title: Add feature
Branch: feature/my-feature → main
URL: https://github.com/user/repo/pull/145

[... rest of output ...]
```

**Notes**: Automatically pushes if branch not tracking remote.

---

### Edge Case: PR to Non-Default Branch

**Scenario**: User wants to PR to develop instead of main.

**Command**:
```bash
/pr "Add feature" --base=develop
```

**Output**:
```
Pull Request Created
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Title: Add feature
Branch: feature/my-feature → develop
URL: https://github.com/user/repo/pull/146

[... rest of output ...]
```

**Notes**: Supports custom base branch for teams using develop → main workflow.

## Workflow Integration Examples

### After /task Workflow

```bash
# Full workflow
/task "implement user profile editing"

# Implementation happens (PRD, TDD, code, QA)
# All tests pass, feature complete

/pr "Add user profile editing"
```

---

### After Phased Workflow

```bash
# Design phase
/architect "notification system"
# Review design, approve

# Implementation phase
/build "notification system"
# Code complete

# Validation phase
/qa "notification system"
# Tests pass

# Ship
/pr "Add real-time notification system"
```

---

### Multiple PRs in Sprint

```bash
/sprint "Q4 performance improvements" --tasks="caching,indexing,lazy-loading"

# After each task completes
/pr "Add Redis caching layer"
/pr "Add database indexes for slow queries"
/pr "Implement lazy loading for images"
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "gh: command not found"

**Error**:
```
Error: GitHub CLI not installed

gh: command not found
```

**Resolution**:
```bash
# macOS
brew install gh

# Linux
sudo apt install gh  # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dnf install gh  # Fedora

# Windows
winget install GitHub.cli
```

---

### "refused to create PR (already exists)"

**Error**:
```
Error: Pull request already exists

PR #142 already exists for this branch:
https://github.com/user/repo/pull/142

To update the PR:
1. Make more commits on this branch
2. Push: git push
3. PR will update automatically

Or view existing PR:
  gh pr view 142 --web
```

**Notes**: Can't create duplicate PRs for same branch. Update existing PR by pushing more commits.

---

### PR Template Not Applied

**Scenario**: Repository has PR template but generated description doesn't match.

**Behavior**: `/pr` generates its own structured description. If repository template is required:

**Manual adjustment**:
```bash
# After PR created
gh pr edit 145 --body "$(cat .github/pull_request_template.md)"

# Then manually fill in template sections
gh pr view 145 --web
```

**Or**: Edit PR description via GitHub UI to match template.
