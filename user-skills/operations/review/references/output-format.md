- PR size and complexity
- Number of issues found
- User preferences expressed in the request

## Recommended Structure

  gh pr review {NUMBER} --request-changes --body "..."
```

## Adaptation Guidelines

**For small PRs (<100 lines)**:
- May combine sections if categories are empty
- Inline summary sufficient
- Skip empty categories entirely

**For large PRs (>500 lines)**:
- Consider per-file or per-component breakdown
- May use extended thinking for deeper analysis
- Group related issues by component

**When all issues are minor**:
- APPROVE recommendation with condensed nits section
- Focus positive feedback on architectural decisions
