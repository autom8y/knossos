---

## Workflows

All teams use **sequential workflows** with complexity gating.

### Workflow Pattern

```
phase-1 → phase-2 → phase-3 → phase-4
   │          │          │          │
   ▼          ▼          ▼          ▼
artifact  artifact  artifact  artifact
```

### Complexity Levels

Each team defines its own complexity levels:

| Team | Levels | Determines |
|------|--------|------------|
| 10x-dev-pack | SCRIPT, MODULE, SERVICE, PLATFORM | Which phases to include |
| doc-team-pack | PAGE, SECTION, SITE | Depth of documentation |
| hygiene-pack | SPOT, MODULE, CODEBASE | Scope of audit |
| debt-triage-pack | QUICK, AUDIT | Extent of analysis |
| sre-pack | TASK, PROJECT, PLATFORM | Operational scope |
| security-pack | PATCH, FEATURE, SYSTEM | Security depth |
| intelligence-pack | METRIC, FEATURE, INITIATIVE | Research scope |
| rnd-pack | SPIKE, EVALUATION, MOONSHOT | Exploration depth |
| strategy-pack | TACTICAL, STRATEGIC, TRANSFORMATION | Planning horizon |
| ecosystem-pack | PATCH, MODULE, SYSTEM, MIGRATION | Infrastructure scope |

---

## Sessions

### TTY-Based Isolation

Each terminal gets its own session:
- Sessions are mapped by TTY hash
- Multiple terminals = multiple concurrent sessions
- No interference between sessions

### Session Artifacts

```
.claude/sessions/{session-id}/
  SESSION_CONTEXT.md    # Current state, blockers, artifacts
  PRD-{slug}.md         # Requirements (if created)
  TDD-{slug}.md         # Design (if created)
```

### Session States

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| ACTIVE | Work in progress |
| PARKED | Paused, preserves context |
| COMPLETED | Wrapped and finalized |

---

## Worktree Isolation

### The Problem

When multiple terminals work on the same project with different teams/sprints, they collide on shared files:
- `.claude/agents/` - overwritten by team switches
- `.claude/ACTIVE_TEAM` - single global file
- `.claude/SPRINT_CONTEXT` - single global file

### The Solution: Git Worktrees

Each worktree is a separate working directory with:
- **Independent `.claude/` ecosystem** - agents, sessions, team isolated
- **Shared git database** - no branch conflicts
- **Full CEM initialization** - complete ecosystem per worktree

### Directory Structure

```
~/Code/project/                     # Main working tree
  .claude/                          # Main ecosystem
  worktrees/                        # Worktree container
    wt-20251224-143052-abc/         # Per-session worktree
      .claude/                      # Independent ecosystem
        agents/                     # Team agents (isolated)
        sessions/                   # Single session
        ACTIVE_TEAM                 # Team state (isolated)
```

### When to Use Worktrees

| Use Case | Why Worktrees? |
|----------|----------------|
| Different teams in parallel | Each worktree can have its own team |
| Multiple sprints at once | Sprint context fully isolated |
| Experimental work | Changes don't affect main project |
| Code review while coding | Review in worktree, continue main work |

### Worktree Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/worktree create "name" --team=PACK` | Create isolated worktree |
| `/worktree list` | List all worktrees with status |
| `/worktree remove <id>` | Remove specific worktree |
| `/worktree cleanup` | Remove stale worktrees (7+ days) |
| `/worktree status` | Detailed worktree info |

### Quick Pattern

```bash
# In main project, want parallel work:
/worktree create "billing-sprint" --team=10x-dev-pack

# Output tells you what to do:
# cd worktrees/wt-xxx && claude

# In new terminal, navigate and start:
cd ~/Code/project/worktrees/wt-xxx
claude
/sprint "Billing Tasks"

# When done:
/wrap  # Offers to remove worktree
```

---

## Hooks

Hooks auto-inject context and automate operations.

| Hook | Event | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| session-context | SessionStart | Load project, team, session, git info |
| auto-park | Stop | Save session state on exit |
| artifact-tracker | PostToolUse | Track PRD/TDD/ADR creation |
| team-validator | PreToolUse | Validate team switch commands |

---

## Skills

Skills provide domain knowledge on-demand.

| Skill | Domain |
|-------|--------|
| 10x-workflow | Agent coordination, handoffs |
| documentation | PRD/TDD/ADR templates |
| standards | Code conventions, tech stack |
| prompting | Copy-paste invocation patterns |
| justfile | Task automation recipes |
| atuin-desktop | Runbook file format |
| initiative-scoping | Session -1/0 protocols |

---

## Global Agents (Singletons)

Some agents persist across team swaps:

```
~/.claude/agents/
  consultant.md           # Ecosystem navigator
  agent-designer.md       # The Forge: role specs
  prompt-architect.md     # The Forge: system prompts
  workflow-engineer.md    # The Forge: orchestration
  platform-engineer.md    # The Forge: infrastructure
  eval-specialist.md      # The Forge: validation
  agent-curator.md        # The Forge: integration
```

**Total Global Agents**: 7 (1 Consultant + 6 Forge)

These are copied into `.claude/agents/` after every team swap.

### The Forge

The Forge is a 6-agent meta-team for creating and maintaining other teams:

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Agent Designer | Creates team specs and role definitions |
| Prompt Architect | Writes agent system prompts |
| Workflow Engineer | Designs orchestration and commands |
| Platform Engineer | Implements roster infrastructure |
| Eval Specialist | Validates teams before shipment |
| Agent Curator | Integrates and syncs Consultant |

**Workflow**: Designer → Prompt Architect → Workflow Engineer → Platform → Eval → Curator

## Quick Start Patterns

### "I want to build a feature"

```bash
/10x                    # Switch to development team
/start "Feature name"   # Initialize session
# Follow the workflow: requirements → design → build → test
/wrap                   # Finalize session
/pr                     # Create pull request
```

### "I want to fix a bug"

```bash
/hotfix                 # Fast-track bug fix workflow
```

### "I want to improve code quality"

```bash
/hygiene                # Switch to hygiene team
/task "Code audit"      # Start quality assessment
```

### "I need documentation"

```bash
/docs                   # Switch to doc team
/task "Document API"    # Start documentation
```

### "I'm not sure what to do"

```bash
/consult                # Get guidance
/consult "describe your goal"  # Get recommendations
```

### "I want to create a new team"

```bash
/forge                  # See The Forge overview
/new-team my-team       # Start team creation workflow
```

### "I want to validate a team"

```bash
/validate-team security-pack   # Run full validation
/eval-agent architect          # Test single agent
```

### "I want to sync this project with skeleton_claude"

```bash
/sync status                   # Check if updates available
/sync                          # Pull latest updates
/sync diff                     # See what changed
```

### "I want to set up a new project with the ecosystem"

```bash
# From terminal (not in Claude)
cd ~/Code/my-new-project
~/Code/skeleton_claude/cem init
```

### "I want to work on multiple things in parallel"

```bash
# Create isolated worktrees for each stream of work
/worktree create "auth-feature" --team=10x-dev-pack
/worktree create "docs-update" --team=doc-team-pack

# Each worktree gets its own terminal:
# Terminal 1: cd worktrees/wt-xxx && claude
# Terminal 2: cd worktrees/wt-yyy && claude

# Work independently with different teams/sprints
# Changes don't collide!

# Check all work streams:
/sessions --all                    # See sessions across worktrees
/worktree list                     # See all active worktrees
```

### "I have an existing session but need to work on something else"

```bash
# Option 1: Park current session, start new
/park
/start "New task"

# Option 2: Use worktree for parallel isolation (recommended)
/worktree create "urgent-fix" --team=10x-dev-pack
# Then in new terminal: cd worktrees/wt-xxx && claude
```
