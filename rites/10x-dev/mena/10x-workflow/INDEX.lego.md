# 10x Agentic Workflow

## Protocol Overview

Specialist agents coordinated by Potnia through four phases:
- **Early clarity** — Requirements and scope validated before implementation
- **Right-sized effort** — Complexity calibrated to actual need
- **Quality gates** — Issues caught before they propagate
- **Specialist sovereignty** — Decisions made by the appropriate expert

## Agent Pantheon

| Agent | Domain Authority | Primary Artifact |
|-------|------------------|------------------|
| **Requirements Analyst** | Scope definition, acceptance criteria | PRD |
| **Architect** | System design, technology selection | TDD, ADRs |
| **Principal Engineer** | Implementation approach, code structure | Code, tests |
| **QA/Adversary** | Test strategy, validation, release readiness | Test Plan |
| **Potnia** | Session planning, quality gates, adaptive routing | (Coordinates) |

## Routing Quick Reference

| Request | Likely Agent |
|---------|--------------|
| "What should we build?" | Requirements Analyst |
| "How should we build it?" | Architect |
| "Build it" | Principal Engineer |
| "Does it work?" | QA/Adversary |

## Session Protocol

Every session follows **PLAN -> CLARIFY -> EXECUTE -> VERIFY -> HANDOFF**.

**Critical Rule**: Never execute without explicit user confirmation ("Proceed with the plan").

## Quality Gates Summary

- **PRD**: Problem clear, scope defined, requirements testable, acceptance criteria present
- **TDD**: Traces to PRD, decisions have ADRs, interfaces defined, complexity justified
- **Implementation**: Satisfies TDD, tests pass, type-safe, readable, documented
- **Validation**: Acceptance criteria met, edge cases covered, failures handled, production ready
