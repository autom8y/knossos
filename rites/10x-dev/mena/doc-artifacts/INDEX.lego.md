# Development Artifact Templates

Templates for the 10x development workflow artifacts.

## PRD Template {#prd-template}

```markdown
# PRD: [Feature Name]

## Overview
[2-3 sentence summary of what and why]

## Impact Assessment
<!-- Required for workflow routing -->
impact: [low | high]
impact_categories: []  <!-- Only populate when impact: high -->

### Impact Categories Reference
- security: Authentication, authorization, encryption, secrets
- data_model: Schema changes, migrations, data integrity
- api_contract: Public API changes, breaking changes, versioning
- auth: Permission model, access control, identity
- cross_service: Multi-service coordination, distributed transactions

### Impact Determination
Flag high-impact when ANY of these apply:
- Changes to authentication/authorization flows
- Database schema modifications
- Public API contract changes
- Security-sensitive code paths
- Cross-service dependencies

## Background
[Context: why now, what problem, who's affected]

## User Stories
- As a [role], I want [capability], so that [benefit]

## Functional Requirements
### Must Have
- FR-1: [requirement]
- FR-2: [requirement]

### Should Have
- FR-3: [requirement]

### Could Have
- FR-4: [requirement]

## Non-Functional Requirements
- NFR-1: Performance - [specific metric]
- NFR-2: Security - [specific requirement]

## Edge Cases
| Case | Expected Behavior |
|------|------------------|
| [scenario] | [behavior] |

## Success Criteria
- [ ] [Testable criterion 1]
- [ ] [Testable criterion 2]

## Out of Scope
- [Explicitly excluded item]

## Open Questions
- [Any unresolved items - ideally none at handoff]
```

### Impact Assessment Examples

**Example 1: Low Impact (UI enhancement)**
```markdown
## Impact Assessment
impact: low
impact_categories: []

Rationale: Styling changes only, no backend modifications, no security implications.
```

**Example 2: High Impact (API change)**
```markdown
## Impact Assessment
impact: high
impact_categories: [api_contract, data_model]

Rationale: Adding new field to user profile requires schema migration and API contract update.
```

**Example 3: High Impact (Security)**
```markdown
## Impact Assessment
impact: high
impact_categories: [security, auth]

Rationale: Modifying password reset flow affects authentication and security-sensitive code.
```

## TDD Template {#tdd-template}

```markdown
# TDD: [Feature Name]

## Overview
[2-3 sentence summary of the technical approach]

## Context
[Link to PRD, relevant constraints, existing system context]

## System Design

### Architecture Diagram
[ASCII or description of component relationships]

### Components

### API Contracts
[Endpoint specifications, request/response formats]

### Sequence Diagrams
[Key flows illustrated step by step]

## Non-Functional Considerations

### Performance
[Scaling approach, caching strategy, performance targets]

### Security
[Authentication, authorization, data protection]

### Reliability
[Failure modes, recovery strategies, monitoring]

## Implementation Guidance
[Recommended patterns, libraries, approaches]

## Risks and Mitigations
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| [risk] | [H/M/L] | [H/M/L] | [strategy] |

## ADRs

## Context
[What situation or problem prompted this decision?]

## Decision
[What is the change that we're proposing or have decided?]

## Alternatives Considered
### Option A: [Name]
