# Security Team (security-pack)

> Map threats. Enforce compliance. Test defenses. Guard the gate.

## Quick Reference

| Component | Location | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Agents | `$ROSTER_HOME/teams/security-pack/agents/` | Agent prompts |
| Workflow | `$ROSTER_HOME/teams/security-pack/workflow.yaml` | Phase configuration |
| Switch | `/security` | Activate this team |

## Team Roster

| Agent | Model | Role | Produces |
|-------|-------|------|----------|
| **threat-modeler** | opus | Maps attack vectors with STRIDE/DREAD | threat-model |
| **compliance-architect** | opus | Translates regulations to requirements | compliance-requirements |
| **penetration-tester** | sonnet | Probes systems for vulnerabilities | pentest-report |
| **security-reviewer** | opus | Final security gate before merge | security-signoff |

## Workflow

```
threat-modeling → compliance-design → penetration-testing → security-review
       │                 │                    │                   │
       ▼                 ▼                    ▼                   ▼
  THREAT-{slug}    COMPLY-{slug}       PENTEST-{slug}        SEC-{slug}
```

### Phase Details

| Phase | Agent | Input | Output |
|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| threat-modeling | threat-modeler | Feature specs | Threat model with STRIDE analysis |
| compliance-design | compliance-architect | Threat model | Control requirements |
| penetration-testing | penetration-tester | Control requirements | Vulnerability findings |
| security-review | security-reviewer | Pentest report | Merge approval/rejection |

## Complexity Levels

| Level | Scope | Phases |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **PATCH** | Single file, no auth/crypto | penetration-testing, security-review |
| **FEATURE** | New endpoints, data handling | All phases |
| **SYSTEM** | Auth, crypto, external integrations | All phases |

## Command Mapping

| Command | Maps To | Use When |
|---------|---------|----------|
| `/security` | Team switch | Activating this team |
| `/architect` | compliance-architect | Compliance mapping only |
| `/build` | penetration-tester | Testing only |
| `/qa` | security-reviewer | Review only |
| `/hotfix` | penetration-tester | Quick security fix |
| `/code-review` | security-reviewer | Security code review |

## When to Use This Team

**Use security-pack when:**
- New feature touches auth, crypto, or PII
- Preparing for compliance audit
- Need pre-release security validation
- Reviewing code with security implications

**Don't use security-pack when:**
- Pure documentation changes → Use doc-team-pack
- General code quality → Use hygiene-pack
- Feature development → Use 10x-dev-pack

**Produces**: `docs/security/COMPLY-{slug}.md`

---

### Penetration Tester

**Purpose**: Probe systems like an authorized adversary

**Key Responsibilities**:
- Vulnerability discovery
- Exploit development
