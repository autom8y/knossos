# /debt - Quick Switch to Technical Debt Team

> **Category**: Team Management | **Phase**: Team Switching

## Purpose

Instantly switch to the debt-triage, a specialized team focused on identifying, assessing, and planning remediation of technical debt across codebases and projects.

This is a convenience wrapper around `/rite debt-triage` that also displays the pantheon after switching.

---

## Usage

```bash
/debt
```

No parameters required. This command:
1. Switches to debt-triage
2. Displays team roster with agent descriptions

---

## Behavior

### 1. Invoke Team Switch

Execute via Bash tool:

```bash
$ROSTER_HOME/swap-rite.sh debt-triage
```

### 2. Display Pantheon

After successful switch, show the active pantheon:

```
Switched to debt-triage (3 agents loaded)

Pantheon:
┌─────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Agent                   │ Role                                         │
├─────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ debt-collector          │ Identifies and catalogs technical debt       │
│ risk-assessor           │ Evaluates impact and urgency of debt         │
│ sprint-planner          │ Creates remediation plans and roadmaps       │
└─────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Use /handoff <agent> to delegate work.
```

### 3. Update SESSION_CONTEXT (if active)

If a session is active:
- Update `active_team` field to `debt-triage`
- Add handoff note documenting team switch

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Switch

```bash
/debt
```

Output:
```
[Roster] Switched to debt-triage (3 agents loaded)

Pantheon:
  - debt-collector: Identifies and catalogs technical debt
  - risk-assessor: Evaluates impact and urgency of debt
  - sprint-planner: Creates remediation plans and roadmaps

Ready for debt triage workflow.
```

### Example 2: Debt Assessment Session

```bash
/debt
/start "Q1 Technical Debt Assessment" --complexity=PLATFORM
```

Output:
```
[Roster] Switched to debt-triage (3 agents loaded)
Session started: Q1 Technical Debt Assessment
Complexity: PLATFORM

Next: Debt Collector will scan codebase for technical debt.
```

### Example 3: Portfolio-Wide Debt Analysis

```bash
/debt
/handoff debt-collector
```

Output:
```
[Roster] Switched to debt-triage (3 agents loaded)
Handing off to: debt-collector

Debt Collector scanning repositories...
Cataloging technical debt items...
```

## Typical Workflow with Debt Team

### Phase 1: Collection
```bash
/debt
/start "Annual Debt Inventory" --complexity=PLATFORM
# Debt Collector scans codebase(s)
# Produces: Debt inventory with 100+ items cataloged
```

### Phase 2: Assessment
```bash
/handoff risk-assessor
# Risk Assessor evaluates each debt item
# Produces: Priority matrix with risk scores
#
# Example output:
# - CRITICAL (6 items): Security vulnerabilities, deprecated APIs in prod
# - HIGH (15 items): Performance bottlenecks, missing tests
# - MEDIUM (42 items): Code duplication, outdated deps
# - LOW (38 items): TODOs, documentation gaps
```

### Phase 3: Planning
```bash
/handoff sprint-planner
# Sprint Planner creates remediation roadmap
# Produces:
# - Q1: Address all CRITICAL items (2 sprints)
# - Q2: Top 10 HIGH items (3 sprints)
# - Q3-Q4: MEDIUM items by ROI (ongoing)
```

### Phase 4: Execution (Hand off to other teams)
```bash
/10x
# Switch to dev team to implement debt fixes
# Or:
/hygiene
# Switch to hygiene team for refactoring work
```

### Phase 5: Tracking
```bash
/debt
/handoff sprint-planner
# Sprint Planner tracks progress
# Updates debt inventory as items are resolved
```

## When to Use Debt Team

Use this team for:

- **Debt inventories**: Comprehensive scans of technical debt
- **Risk assessment**: Prioritizing what debt to pay down
- **Roadmap planning**: Multi-quarter debt remediation plans
- **Portfolio management**: Tracking debt across multiple projects
- **Due diligence**: Assessing acquired or inherited codebases
- **Budget justification**: Quantifying debt impact for leadership
- **Velocity improvements**: Finding debt slowing development

**Don't use for**:
- Executing refactoring → Use `/hygiene` instead
- New feature work → Use `/10x` instead
- Documentation → Use `/docs` instead

---

## Debt vs Hygiene Teams

| Debt Team | Hygiene Team |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Focus**: Strategic debt management | **Focus**: Tactical code cleanup |
| **Scope**: Portfolio/project-level | **Scope**: Module/file-level |
| **Output**: Inventories, roadmaps, plans | **Output**: Refactored code, cleanliness |
| **Horizon**: Quarterly/annual planning | **Horizon**: Sprint/week execution |
| **Agents**: Collector, Assessor, Planner | **Agents**: Smeller, Enforcer, Janitor, Audit Lead |

**Workflow**: Use `/debt` to plan, `/hygiene` to execute.

```bash
# Strategic planning
/debt
/start "Q1 Debt Paydown Plan"
# Produces roadmap

# Tactical execution
/hygiene
/start "Refactor authentication module"
# Executes item from roadmap
```

---

## State Changes

### Files Modified

| File | Change | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `.claude/ACTIVE_RITE` | Set to `debt-triage` | Active rite state |
| `.claude/agents/` | Populated | 3 agent files loaded |
| `.claude/sessions/{session_id}/SESSION_CONTEXT.md` | `active_team` updated | If session active |

---

## Success Criteria

- Team switched to debt-triage
- 3 agent files present in `.claude/agents/`
- Team roster displayed to user
- If session active, SESSION_CONTEXT updated

---

## Error Handling

If swap fails:

```
[Roster] Error: Rite 'debt-triage' not found
[Roster] Use '/rite --list' to see available packs
```

**Resolution**: Verify roster installation at `$ROSTER_HOME/`

## Debt Tracking Artifacts

Debt team produces structured artifacts:

### debt-inventory.yaml
```yaml
---
scan_date: "2025-12-24"
scope: "platform-wide"
items:
  - id: DEBT-001
    category: security
    severity: critical
    title: "Deprecated bcrypt version with known CVE"
    location: "auth-service/package.json"
    impact: "Remote code execution risk"
    effort_estimate: "2 hours"
    priority: 1
  - id: DEBT-002
    category: performance
    severity: high
    title: "N+1 query in user dashboard"
    location: "api/controllers/dashboard.js:45"
    impact: "2s load time for 1000+ users"
    effort_estimate: "1 day"
    priority: 2
```

### remediation-roadmap.md

## Notes

### Debt vs Feature Tradeoffs

Leadership often asks: "Should we build features or pay down debt?"

Debt team provides data for this decision:
- **Velocity impact**: "Debt costs us 20% velocity (2 days/sprint)"
- **Risk quantification**: "CRITICAL items have 30% probability of production incident"
- **ROI analysis**: "Fixing top 10 items yields 15% velocity gain for 1 sprint investment"

This enables evidence-based prioritization.

### Difference from /team

| Command | Behavior |
|---------|----------|
| `/rite debt-triage` | Switches team, shows swap confirmation |
| `/debt` | Switches team, shows roster with agent descriptions |

Use `/debt` when you want to see available agents after switching.

### Debt Categories

Common debt categories tracked:
- **Code quality**: Duplication, complexity, smells
- **Testing**: Coverage gaps, flaky tests
- **Security**: Vulnerabilities, outdated auth
- **Performance**: Bottlenecks, inefficiencies
- **Dependencies**: Outdated libraries, deprecated APIs
- **Documentation**: Missing/outdated docs
- **Architecture**: Violations of ADRs, drift
- **Infrastructure**: Manual processes, missing automation

Debt Collector tags items by category for filtering.

### Continuous Debt Tracking

Recommended cadence:
- **Weekly**: Debt Collector scans (automated)
- **Monthly**: Risk Assessor re-prioritizes
- **Quarterly**: Sprint Planner updates roadmap
- **Annual**: Comprehensive portfolio debt review

Prevents debt from growing out of control.
