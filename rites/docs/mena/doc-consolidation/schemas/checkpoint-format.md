# Checkpoint Format

> **Purpose**: Define the structure for `.consolidation/checkpoint-{topic}.yaml` files that capture workflow state, enabling any agent to resume consolidation work without re-reading sources or re-analyzing content.

## Design Principles

1. **Semantic State**: Capture understanding, not just completion status
2. **Resumability**: Any agent can pick up where another left off
3. **Dependency Tracking**: Know what inputs affect what outputs
4. **Audit Trail**: Record who did what and when

## Validation Rules

### Required Fields

| Field | Rule |
|-------|------|
| `schema_version` | Must be semantic version string |
| `topic.id` | Must be kebab-case, match extraction topic.id |
| `status.phase` | Must be valid phase enum value |
| `status.state` | Must be valid state for the phase |
| `sources` | Must have at least one entry |
| `extraction.path` | Must point to existing extraction file |
| `concepts` | Must have at least one entry after Phase 1 |
| `synthesis.status` | Must be valid synthesis status enum |
| `activity_log` | Must have at least one entry (creation) |

### Enum Constraints

```yaml
phase:
  - discovery      # Phase 0: Finding and cataloging sources
  - extraction     # Phase 1: Creating extraction artifact
  - synthesis      # Phase 2: Writing consolidated document
  - review         # Phase 3: Validation and approval
  - complete       # Phase 4: Done, monitoring for staleness

state:
  # Discovery phase states
  - scanning       # Looking for relevant files
  - cataloging     # Building manifest entry
  - mapped         # Manifest complete, ready for extraction

  # Extraction phase states
  - reading        # Ingesting source files
  - analyzing      # Identifying sections and conflicts
  - resolving      # Working through conflicts
  - extracted      # Extraction artifact complete

  # Synthesis phase states
  - planning       # Determining document structure
  - drafting       # Writing sections
  - integrating    # Connecting sections, adding transitions
  - polishing      # Final edits and formatting
  - drafted        # Draft complete, ready for review

  # Review phase states
  - pending_review # Waiting for reviewer
  - in_review      # Actively being reviewed
  - revising       # Addressing feedback
  - approved       # Review passed

  # Complete phase states
  - published      # Document in final location
  - monitoring     # Watching for source changes

source_status:
  - current        # Hash matches, no re-reading needed
  - stale          # Hash changed, re-extraction may be needed
  - new            # File added since last checkpoint
  - deleted        # File removed since last checkpoint

synthesis_status:
  - not_started    # Haven't begun writing
  - in_progress    # Actively drafting
  - draft_complete # All sections drafted
  - final          # Approved and published

section_status:
  - pending        # Not started
  - drafted        # Initial draft written
  - reviewed       # Reviewer has seen it
  - final          # Approved, no more changes

confidence:
  - high           # Clear, unambiguous understanding
  - medium         # Mostly clear, some uncertainty
  - low            # Significant gaps or confusion

review_status:
  - pending        # Awaiting review
  - approved       # Passed review
  - changes_requested  # Needs revision

dependency_status:
  - satisfied      # Dependent topic is complete
  - pending        # Dependent topic not yet complete
  - blocking       # Cannot proceed until dependency resolved
```

### Business Rules

1. **Phase Progression**: Phases must progress in order: discovery -> extraction -> synthesis -> review -> complete
2. **State Consistency**: State must be valid for current phase
3. **Source Tracking**: All sources in extraction must appear in checkpoint sources
4. **Hash Verification**: If any source hash differs from extraction, status should be "stale"
5. **Conflict Gate**: Cannot enter synthesis phase if `extraction.conflicts_pending > 0` with blocking severity
6. **Activity Logging**: Every state change must add an activity_log entry
7. **Concept Population**: `concepts` array must be populated before leaving extraction phase

## Usage Notes

### For Any Agent Resuming Work

1. **Read checkpoint first** - understand current state before proceeding
2. **Verify source freshness** - check hashes against actual files
3. **Load concepts** - use recorded understanding as starting point
4. **Check for blockers** - respect `blocked_by` and dependency status
5. **Continue from current state** - don't restart completed work

### Staleness Handling

When source hashes don't match:

```yaml
# Stale source detected
sources:
  - path: ".ledge/specs/TDD-0042-settings.md"
    hash: "old_hash..."      # From checkpoint
    status: stale            # Computed by comparing to actual file

# Decision tree:
# 1. If in discovery/extraction phase: re-extract that source
# 2. If in synthesis phase: check if stale section affects current work
# 3. If in review/complete: flag for re-consolidation
```

### Activity Log Best Practices

- Log every phase/state transition
- Log significant decisions (not minor edits)
- Include agent identifier for traceability
- Keep details concise but specific
- Never delete log entries (append-only)

### Checkpoint Location

```
.consolidation/
  checkpoint-settings-merge.yaml     # This file
  checkpoint-hook-lifecycle.yaml     # Another topic
  extraction-settings-merge.yaml     # Related extraction
  extraction-hook-lifecycle.yaml     # Related extraction
```

### Recovery Scenarios

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Agent crash mid-section | Resume from `current_section`, check `notes` |
| Source file changed | Mark stale, re-extract affected sections |
| Conflict discovered late | Return to extraction phase, update conflicts |
| Review rejected | Set state to "revising", address feedback |
| Dependency blocked | Wait or escalate, do not proceed |
