# Quality Gates Between Phases

> **Purpose**: Mandatory checkpoints between consolidation phases with specific pass/fail criteria. No phase proceeds until its gate passes.

## Design Principles

1. **No Phase Skipping**: Gates enforce sequential progression
2. **Explicit Criteria**: Every gate has measurable pass/fail conditions
3. **Blocking vs. Warning**: Distinguish what blocks progress vs. what needs attention
4. **Traceability**: Gate passage is logged with timestamp and approver

      failure: "Dependency cycle detected: {cycle}"

  warning_checks:
    ambiguous_flagged:
      rule: "files with unclear topic mapping are in ambiguous[]"
      action: "Review ambiguous mappings before extraction"

  on_pass:
    - log: "Manifest Gate passed at {timestamp}"
    - update checkpoint status to "extraction_ready"

  on_fail:
    - log: "Manifest Gate failed: {failure_reasons}"
    - block progression to Phase 1
