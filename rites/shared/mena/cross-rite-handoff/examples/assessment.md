## Context

The 10x-dev has completed PRD and TDD for a major payment processing overhaul. This feature handles credit card tokenization and requires security assessment before implementation can proceed.

### Why This Handoff

- Complexity: SERVICE
- Security considerations: Payment data, PCI-DSS compliance
- Blocking: Yes - cannot proceed to implementation without threat model

## Source Artifacts

| Artifact | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| PRD-payment-processing.md | Approved | Sections 3.2, 3.3 cover security requirements |
| TDD-payment-processing.md | In Review | Section 4.2 has data flow diagram |

## Notes for Security Team

1. Priority SEC-001 before SEC-002 (dependency)
2. PCI-DSS Level 1 compliance required
3. Third-party payment processor: Stripe
4. Expected response timeline: 48 hours (critical priority)

## Acceptance Criteria for This Handoff

- [ ] Threat model document produced
- [ ] Trust boundaries identified and validated
- [ ] Specific mitigations recommended for identified threats
- [ ] Go/No-Go verdict provided
