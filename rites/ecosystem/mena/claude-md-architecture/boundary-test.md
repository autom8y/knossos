# CLAUDE.md Boundary Test

A practical checklist for determining if content belongs in CLAUDE.md. Before adding ANY content, run through these five questions.

---

## The Five-Question Test

### Question 1: Stability Test

> "Will this content be accurate in one month without updates?"

| Answer | Verdict |
|--------|---------|
| Yes | Proceed to Question 2 |
| No | **STOP. Does not belong in CLAUDE.md.** |

**Examples that fail**:
- Current task or initiative
- Sprint goals
- Git branch name
- Recent decisions
- "Last updated" timestamps

**Where it should go**: SESSION_CONTEXT, session files, hook output

---

### Question 2: Source of Truth Test

> "Is CLAUDE.md the authoritative source for this content?"

| Answer | Verdict |
|--------|---------|
| Yes, CLAUDE.md is THE source | Proceed to Question 3 |
| No, derived from elsewhere | **Consider regeneration or hook injection instead** |

**Examples that fail**:
- Git state (derived from repository)
- Session state (derived from SESSION_CONTEXT)
- Rite catalog (derived from ACTIVE_RITE + agents/)
- Build status (derived from CI)

**Correct approach**: Inject via hooks or regenerate from authoritative source

---

### Question 3: Scope Test

> "Does this content apply to ALL sessions in this project?"

| Answer | Verdict |
|--------|---------|
| Yes, project-wide | Proceed to Question 4 |
| No, session-specific | **STOP. Belongs in SESSION_CONTEXT or hook output.** |

**Examples that fail**:
- Current initiative
- Handoff context
- Parked session info
- "Currently working on..."
- Phase-specific decisions

**Where it should go**: SESSION_CONTEXT for persistent session state, hook output for transient context

---

### Question 4: Propagation Test

> "Should changes to this content flow between knossos and satellites?"

| Answer | Sync Behavior | Section Type |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Yes, knossos -> satellites | SYNC | Infrastructure section |
| No, satellite-only | PRESERVE | Identity/Extension section |
| Regenerated from ACTIVE_RITE | REGENERATE | Rite configuration |

**Use this to determine section ownership**:
- Infrastructure docs (skills, hooks, routing) = SYNC
- Project-specific content = PRESERVE or `## Project:*`
- Agent rite catalog = REGENERATE from ACTIVE_RITE

---

### Question 5: Noise Test

> "If this content disappeared, would Claude work less effectively?"

| Answer | Verdict |
|--------|---------|
| Yes, Claude needs this | Essential content, include it |
| No, nice-to-have | Consider removing or relocating |

**Essential content examples**:
- Skills activation table
- Agent routing guidance
- Workflow patterns
- Hook documentation

**Noise examples**:
- Historical context
- Informational notes
- "FYI" content
- Redundant references

## Red Flags Checklist

If your content contains any of these, reconsider:

| Red Flag | Why Problematic | Correct Approach |
|----------|-----------------|------------------|
| Dates or timestamps | Immediately stale | Use git history |
| "Currently..." | Session state | SESSION_CONTEXT |
| "Last updated..." | Maintenance burden | Git history |
| "Working on..." | Task state | Session files |
| Git branch names | Changes every checkout | Hook injection |
| Commit hashes | Changes every commit | Hook injection |
| File paths that change | Fragile references | Relative or regenerated |
| Personal preferences | User-specific | ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md |
| Specific version numbers | Unless truly stable | Keep minimal |
| "Today" or "yesterday" | Time-relative | Never use |

---

## Correct Placement Guide

| Content Type | Correct Location | Why |
|--------------|------------------|-----|
| Skills documentation | CLAUDE.md (SYNC) | Stable, project-wide |
| Agent rite catalog | CLAUDE.md (REGENERATE) | Derived from knossos |
| Workflow patterns | CLAUDE.md (SYNC) | Stable infrastructure |
| Project extensions | CLAUDE.md (`## Project:*`) | Satellite-owned |
| Current task | SESSION_CONTEXT | Session-specific |
| Session phase | SESSION_CONTEXT | Changes during session |
| Parked session info | SESSION_CONTEXT | Ephemeral |
| Git status | Hook output | Changes constantly |
| Worktree context | Hook output | Ephemeral |
| Personal preferences | ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md | User-scoped |
| Sprint details | PRD or session files | Dynamic |
| Historical decisions | Session summaries | Archival |

---

## The Ultimate Test

Before committing any CLAUDE.md change:

> "Is this a behavioral contract (what Claude can do and how) or transient state (what's happening now)?"

| Answer | Result |
|--------|--------|
| **Behavioral contract** | Belongs in CLAUDE.md |
| **Transient state** | Belongs elsewhere |

---
