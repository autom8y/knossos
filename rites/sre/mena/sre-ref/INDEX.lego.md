# /sre - Quick Switch to Reliability Team

> **Category**: Team Management | **Phase**: Team Switching

## Purpose

Instantly switch to the sre, a Site Reliability Engineering team focused on system reliability, observability, incident response, and chaos engineering.

This is a convenience wrapper around `/rite sre` that also displays the pantheon after switching.

---

## Usage

```bash
/sre
```

No parameters required. This command:
1. Switches to sre
2. Displays team roster with agent descriptions

---

## Behavior

### 1. Invoke Team Switch

Execute via Bash tool:

```bash
$ROSTER_HOME/swap-rite.sh sre
```

### 2. Display Pantheon

After successful switch, show the active pantheon:

```
Switched to sre (4 agents loaded)

Pantheon:
┌─────────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Agent                   │ Role                                         │
├─────────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ observability-engineer  │ Metrics, logs, traces, dashboards, alerts    │
│ incident-commander      │ War room coordination, postmortems           │
│ platform-engineer       │ CI/CD, IaC, deployment automation            │
│ chaos-engineer          │ Fault injection, resilience testing          │
└─────────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Use /handoff <agent> to delegate work.
```

### 3. Update SESSION_CONTEXT (if active)

If a session is active:
- Update `active_team` field to `sre`
- Add handoff note documenting team switch

### Complexity Levels

| Level | Scope | Phases |
|-------|-------|--------|
| ALERT | Single alert/dashboard fix | implementation, resilience |
| SERVICE | Single service reliability | observation, coordination, implementation, resilience |
| SYSTEM | Multi-service SLOs/SLIs | observation, coordination, implementation, resilience |
| PLATFORM | Full platform reliability | observation, coordination, implementation, resilience |

---

## Agents

### observability-engineer.md
**Role**: Metrics, logs, traces, dashboards, alerts
**Invocation**: `Act as **Observability Engineer**`
**Purpose**: Makes the invisible visible—catches degradation before customers do

**Color**: Orange | **Model**: Claude Sonnet

**When to use**:
- Evaluating monitoring coverage and gaps
- Designing dashboards and alerting
- Defining SLIs and SLOs
- Instrumenting applications for observability

**Produces**:
- Observability reports
- Dashboard specifications
- Alert configurations
- SLI/SLO definitions

---

### incident-commander.md
**Role**: War room coordination, postmortems
**Invocation**: `Act as **Incident Commander**`
**Purpose**: Runs the war room when systems are on fire; prevents repeat incidents through blameless postmortems

**Color**: Purple | **Model**: Claude Opus

**When to use**:
- Active incident requiring coordination
- Post-incident analysis and postmortems
- Reliability planning and prioritization
- Stakeholder communication during outages

**Produces**:
- Reliability plans
- Postmortem documents
- Incident timelines
- Action item tracking

---

### platform-engineer.md
**Role**: CI/CD, IaC, deployment automation
**Invocation**: `Act as **Platform Engineer**`
**Purpose**: Builds the roads developers drive on—makes deploying to production boring

**Color**: Cyan | **Model**: Claude Sonnet

**When to use**:
- CI/CD pipeline improvements
- Infrastructure as code changes
- Developer environment optimization
- Deployment reliability work

**Produces**:
- Pipeline configurations
- Infrastructure code
- Developer tools and scripts
- Runbooks

---

### chaos-engineer.md
**Role**: Fault injection, resilience testing
**Invocation**: `Act as **Chaos Engineer**`
**Purpose**: Breaks production on purpose—finds cracks in resilience before real outages do

## Command Mapping

When sre is active, commands route to these agents:

| Command | Routes To | Purpose |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| `/start` | observability-engineer | Begin with observability assessment |
| `/architect` | platform-engineer | Design infrastructure/platform changes |
| `/build` | platform-engineer | Implement infrastructure changes |
| `/qa` | chaos-engineer | Validate resilience through chaos testing |
| `/hotfix` | incident-commander | Fast incident response path |
| `/code-review` | chaos-engineer | Review for reliability patterns |

---

## When to Use This Rite

**Use sre for**:
- Observability improvements (dashboards, alerts, SLOs)
- Incident response preparation
- Platform and infrastructure work
- Chaos engineering and resilience testing
- Post-incident analysis and prevention

**Don't use for**:
- Feature development (use 10x-dev)
- Documentation cleanup (use docs)
- Code quality/refactoring (use hygiene)
- Technical debt triage (use debt-triage)

---

## Integration with Other Teams

The SRE pack often collaborates with other teams:

| Situation | Integration |
|-----------|-------------|
| Reliability issues in code | Hand off to 10x-dev for fixes |
| Documentation gaps in runbooks | Hand off to docs |
| Technical debt causing incidents | Hand off to debt-triage |
| Code quality affecting reliability | Hand off to hygiene |

---

## Example Workflows

### Observability Improvement
```
/sre
/start "Improve monitoring coverage for payment service"
→ Observability Engineer assesses gaps
→ Incident Commander prioritizes improvements
→ Platform Engineer implements dashboards/alerts
→ Chaos Engineer validates detection works
```

### Incident Post-Mortem
```
/sre
/hotfix "Database outage caused 30-minute downtime"
→ Incident Commander runs postmortem
→ Produces action items
→ Platform Engineer implements fixes
→ Chaos Engineer validates resilience
```

### Pre-Launch Resilience
```
/sre
/task "Certify checkout service for Black Friday traffic"
→ Observability Engineer baselines metrics
→ Chaos Engineer runs stress tests
→ Documents breaking points and mitigations
```
