# Innovation Lab (rnd)

> Scout. Integrate. Prototype. Envision.

## Quick Reference

| Component | Location | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Agents | `$ROSTER_HOME/rites/rnd/agents/` | Agent prompts |
| Workflow | `$ROSTER_HOME/rites/rnd/workflow.yaml` | Phase configuration |
| Switch | `/rnd` | Activate this team |

## Pantheon

| Agent | Model | Role | Produces |
|-------|-------|------|----------|
| **technology-scout** | sonnet | Watches the technology horizon | tech-assessment |
| **integration-researcher** | sonnet | Maps integration paths | integration-map |
| **prototype-engineer** | sonnet | Builds decision-ready demos | prototype |
| **moonshot-architect** | opus | Designs future systems | moonshot-plan |

## Workflow

```
scouting → integration-analysis → prototyping → future-architecture
    │              │                  │                │

```

### Phase Details

| Phase | Agent | Input | Output |
|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| scouting | technology-scout | Technology question | Tech assessment |
| integration-analysis | integration-researcher | Tech assessment | Integration map |
| prototyping | prototype-engineer | Integration map | Working prototype |
| future-architecture | moonshot-architect | Prototype learnings | Long-term plan |

## Complexity Levels

| Level | Scope | Phases |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **SPIKE** | Quick feasibility check | scouting, prototyping |
| **EVALUATION** | Full technology evaluation | All phases |
| **MOONSHOT** | Paradigm shift exploration | All phases |

## Command Mapping

| Command | Maps To | Use When |
|---------|---------|----------|
| `/rnd` | Team switch | Activating this team |
| `/architect` | integration-researcher | Integration analysis only |
| `/build` | prototype-engineer | Prototyping only |
| `/qa` | moonshot-architect | Future architecture only |
| `/hotfix` | N/A | Not applicable (R&D team) |
| `/code-review` | N/A | Not applicable (R&D team) |

## When to Use This Rite

**Use rnd when:**
- Evaluating new technologies
- Building proof-of-concept prototypes
- Planning long-term architecture
- Exploring paradigm shifts

**Don't use rnd when:**
- Building production features → Use 10x-dev
- Security assessment → Use security
- Business analysis → Use strategy
