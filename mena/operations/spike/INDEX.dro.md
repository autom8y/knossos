## Context
Auto-injected by SessionStart hook (project, rite, session, git).

## Pre-flight

1. **Arguments required**:
   - Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for spike topic
   - If empty: ERROR "Spike topic required. Usage: /spike 'exploration topic'"

## Your Task

Conduct time-boxed research to answer a technical question. $ARGUMENTS

**NO PRODUCTION CODE. Research and report only.**

## Behavior

1. **Define the question**:
   - What are we trying to learn?
   - What decision will this inform?
   - What's the timebox?

2. **Research**:
   - Explore existing codebase
   - Search documentation
   - Evaluate alternatives
   - Build throwaway POC if needed

3. **Document findings**:
   - Create spike report
   - Comparison matrix (if evaluating options)
   - Recommendation with rationale

4. **Timebox checkpoints**:
   - 25% mark: Initial findings
   - 50% mark: Deep dive complete
   - 75% mark: Draft recommendation
   - 100% mark: Final report

## Output

Spike report at `.sos/wip/SPIKE-{slug}.md`:
- Question and context
- Approach taken
- Findings
- Recommendation
- Follow-up actions

## Example

```
/spike "Can we use GraphQL instead of REST?" --timebox=4h
/spike "What's the best approach for real-time updates?"
```

### On Success

End your response with:

🔭 explored · next: {hint}

**Fork-context note**: This command may run without conversation history. To resolve the hint, read session state from disk:
- Find active session: look for `status: "ACTIVE"` in `.sos/sessions/*/SESSION_CONTEXT.md`
- No active session found → output `🔭 explored` without hint.

Natural follow-on: `next: /consult` (to plan next steps based on findings) or `next: /sos start` (if the spike informed a new initiative).

### On Failure

❌ spike failed: {brief reason} · fix: {recovery}

Infer recovery: no topic provided → provide a topic string; uncertain → `/consult`.
