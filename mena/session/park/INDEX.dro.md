## Context
Auto-injected by SessionStart hook (project, rite, session, git).

## Your Task

Pause the current work session and save state for later resumption. $ARGUMENTS

## Session Resolution

Session state is pre-computed by the SessionStart hook (injected above).
Read Has Session, Session State from the context table — do not call `ari session status`.

## Pre-flight

1. Verify an active session exists (check Session State from injected context)
2. Check session is not already parked

## Behavior

1. **Extract Session ID**:
   Read the Session Context table injected above. Extract the session ID from: `| Session | <session-id> |`
   You MUST pass this to Moirai — the CLI cannot discover it from a Bash subprocess.

2. **Capture state**:
   - Current phase and last agent
   - Artifacts produced so far
   - Git status (warn about uncommitted changes)
   - Open questions and blockers

3. **Delegate to Moirai** for session state mutation:
   ```
   Task(moirai, "park_session reason=\"<REASON>\" session_id=\"<session-id>\"")
   ```
   Moirai will:
   - Acquire lock to prevent race conditions
   - Execute `ari session park --reason="<REASON>"`
   - Validate the result and log to audit trail
   - Return structured response

3. **Display parking summary** to user:
   - Duration so far
   - Progress (completed/in-progress artifacts)
   - Next steps when resuming
   - Park reason and timestamp

## Example

```
/park "Waiting for stakeholder feedback on PRD"
```

Output:
```
Session parked at 2025-12-24 15:30

Progress: PRD complete, TDD in progress
Duration: 2h 15m
Reason: Waiting for stakeholder feedback on PRD

Resume with: /continue
```

## Sigil

### On Success

End your response with:

⏸️ parked · next: /continue (when ready)

### On Failure

❌ park failed: {brief reason} · fix: {recovery}

Infer recovery: no active session → `/start`; session already parked → `/continue`; uncertain → `/consult`.
